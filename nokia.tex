    \item[Worked] mainly on the positioning daemon for a new GNU/Linux-based low-cost smartphone operating system.
      \begin{my_bullets}
        \item Redesign and refactoring of major components of the daemon (IPC, Class design etc) initially designed for MeeGo thus using a resource-heavy design and implementation. Refactoring was done to enable it to work efficiently in a far more resource-restricted platform (memory and CPU).
        \item Extending the positioning stack with new functionality and test cases.
        \item Heavy debugging of time-critical issues and memory profiling of the daemon (valgrind).
      \end{my_bullets}
    \item[Developed] a new interface for ofono (open source telephony) bridging RRLP/RRC functionality between the modem and the positioning daemon.
    \item[SDK] super-user. Participated in testing, requirements and actively supporting it for the middle-ware group.
