    \item[Developer] for the positioning daemon for a new GNU/Linux-based low-cost smartphone operating system.
        Worked on porting and refactoring of major components of the daemon (IPC, Class design etc) initially designed
        for MeeGo thus using a resource-heavy design and implementation. Refactoring was done to enable it to work
        efficiently in a far more resource-restricted platform (memory and CPU).
    \item[Developed] a new interface for ofono (open source telephony) bridging RRLP/RRC functionality between the
      modem and the positioning daemon.
    \item[SDK] super-user. Participated in testing, requirements and actively supporting it for the middle-ware group.
