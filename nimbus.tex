      \item[Developed] a Fire Training Unit built around different hardware sensors and providing a fully visualized localization application. Designed the system architecture and implemented in PyGame a real-time, 2D basic visualization of trainees movement.
      \item[Developed] a Flow Cytometry application, using Qt, which provides real-time scatter plots and histograms of flow cytometry data. Additionally developed a Flow Cytometry Standard library to generate files based on the FCS3.1 standard.
      \item[Researcher] and developer of an approach to address navigational and data entry problems in
        legacy applications displayed on touch screens in medical environments. Developed an
        adapted pattern recognition method for user interfaces which was implemented as a cross-platform,
        real-time toolkit independent of the graphical toolkit used by any 3rd party application.
