        \begin{my_bullets}
          \item Started alone in the team while looking for a lead architect. Responsibilities in the team
            included requirement elicitation, architecture design, technology reviews/decisions,
            coordination of multiple domains to evaluate and drive technical decisions and various
            technical tasks needed on different phases.
          \item Drove the collection of requirements for the application framework, setting up of the team
            and designing/reviewing the framework architecture.
          \item Drove the centralization of the systemd unit files and the system configuration, developed the
            Yocto recipes to control the deployment on the different head unit images and wrote tests to
            verify running configuration against specified configuration.
        \end{my_bullets}
      \item[Security Engineer] (June 2014 - January 2015)
        \begin{my_bullets}
          \item Participated in requirement review.
          \item Evaluated technologies/solution/architecture.
          \item Participated in the evaluation of different suppliers and clarifications of requirements with them
            during offers

      \item[Developer] for Head-Unit connectivity components (May 2013 - May 2014)
        Participated in the re-factoring of two Linux daemons written in C to C++. The re-factoring was essential
        in order to use the daemons with some C++ generated bindings. In parallel re-designed the state-machine.
        Parallel tasks included training of colleagues on git/gerrit workflow and best practices and C++11 features.
      \item[Developer] for Bluetooth proof-of-concepts (October 2012 - May 2013)
        \begin{my_bullets}
          \item Bluetooth / Bluez (C).  Worked on a proof of concept for AVRCP 1.5 for BlueZ.
            In parallel provided a few bug fixes upstream and supported Genivi discussion to define the
            GENIVI Bluetooth API.
          \item Bluetooth testing framework (python). Designed and implemented a testing framework to
            test BMW specific BMW use cases. The framework was able to support different backends and
            Bluetooth profiles.
        \end{my_bullets}
      \item[Member] of the BMW CarIT core interview team
      \item[Mentoring] of a student during their internship. The student became an active part of the developing
        team implementing and testing different features. As a second step the student did their bachelor thesis
        under my supervision.
