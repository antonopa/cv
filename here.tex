      \item[Senior Principal Architect] (February 2017 - Present)
        \begin{my_bullets}
        \item Responsibilities in the team include requirement elicitation, architecture design,
          customer engagement, technology reviews/decisions, coordination of multiple domains to
          evaluate and drive technical decisions, and various technical tasks needed on different
          phases. Some notable examples are:
            \begin{my_bullets}
            \item Working as a project lead, in parallel to the solution architecture role, in order to
              deliver a highly innovative feature for automotive use cases (visualization and guidance) around
              HERE's HD road content. This effort involved coordinating multiple internal and external
              organizations, identifying gaps towards customer commitments, defining an end-to-end
              solution bridging the available data and the customer's requirements.
            \item Defined and documented the modile SDK solution for a major automotive customer, by reviewing
              requirements, discussing with the customer and coordinating multiple internal domains in order
              to define a commonly agreed architecture solution.
            \item Defined a solution for NDS Streaming, a functionality not supported by the standard, but
              needed for the Here mobile SDK delivered to a customer to fulfill a contractual requirement.
            \item Supported the definition, and the development of an initial prototype, for an in-house
              IDL engine. Worked with multiple domains to re-shape their public APIs and write the IDL around
              them.
            \item Continuously supporting the architecture team:
              \begin{my_bullets}
              \item Support the chief of architect to define processes needed for the team,
              \item Led multiple cross-domain regular syncs (creating an agenda, collecting open topics,
                moderating)
              \item Created a newsletter, as means to keep the organization up-to-date with some of the hot
                topics the architecture team has been involved with
              \end{my_bullets}
